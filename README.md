## Background to select the Research Area

We have so many research areas to do on noise environments for example audio, video and image analysis etc., but these are common in now a days to do on these type of topics. So, I selected Health care Department to do my research. My goal is simply to inspire the world and open eyes to show how studying computer deep learning, AI, ML and then applying that knowledge to the medical field can make a big impact on the world. As per my research I see only few papers were published on health care when compare to other research areas. Most of the recent papers were published on EHR (Electronic health records) it might be diabetes, heart diseases, Allergy information, Emergency department visits, Hospital discharge summaries and reports, Drug and Pharmacy Service Information , Neurophysiology reports, Patient consultation reports etc., As per my knowledge we had few papers only worked on respiratory reports.

EHR Data is the data being collected when we see a doctor, pick up a prescription at the pharmacy, or even from a visit to the dentist. These are just a few of the examples where HER data is collected. This data is used for a variety of use-cases. From personalizing healthcare to discovering novel drugs and treatments to helping providers diagnose patients better and reduce medical errors.

Since 2020, we see world suffering from dangerous virus called COVID-19. Once the patient effected by this virus it will act as a slow poison to him to die main reason for this is respiratory problem, this virus will infect all tissues inside the lungs so, slowly it will be very hard to the human to take breath and finally he will die. In mean time every doctor will do chest x-ray scan to measure the severity of the disease and infection inside the lungs. 

Usually medical guys will know the status of the disease very easily by seeing the reports and X-ray images but the public who don’t have idea on medical terms they will not understand the infected area and infected severity.

## Research on Chest X-rays:
After having above idea in my mind I just want to do research on available X-Rays to know the severity of the disease and level of infection inside the body so that public can alert and have a chance to consult or ask doctor for remedy for the damage and doctors can easily identify and give proper medication to the patient. I thought to explore X-ray images as doctors frequently use X-rays and CT scans to diagnose pneumonia, lung inflammation, abscesses, and enlarged lymph nodes. Since COVID-19 attacks the epithelial cells that line our respiratory tract, we can use X-rays to analyse the health of a patient’s lungs. Given that nearly all hospitals have X-ray imaging machines, it could be possible to use X-rays to test for COVID-19 without the dedicated test kits.

A drawback is that X-ray analysis requires a radiology expert and takes significant time which is precious when people are sick around the world. Therefore developing an automated analysis system is required to save medical professionals valuable time.
